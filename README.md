==========

DevOps support for TFS driven teams using TFS Build, Release Management and other components on the Microsoft Stack.

<br />
## Current TFS Build activities

### AzureVmScale
Allows the scaling of multiple VMs in Azure through a TFS build definition.
The end goal is to allow developers to control build definitions that are normally scheduled builds to downscale and upscale environments outside
working hours to reduce costs and at the same time because the VMs are still up, do continuous deployments during the night.
